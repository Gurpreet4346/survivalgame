AudioManager.cs:The AudioManager script centralizes audio control using a singleton pattern to persist across scenes, managing background music (main menu and game) . It provides methods to toggle music on/off based on user settings, ensuring seamless audio transitions and global access throughout the project.
BackGroundMusicManager.cs:The BackgroundMusicManager script plays the appropriate background music for the current scene by checking if the active scene is the Main Menu or another scene and then using the AudioManager to play the corresponding music.
CharacterSelection.cs:The CharacterSelection script manages character preview and selection in the main menu. It allows cycling through an array of character prefabs using next and button, displaying the selected character at a specified position with its stats (name, health, speed) updated in the UI. When "Play" is clicked, the selected character's index is saved using PlayerPrefs, and the gameplay scene is loaded.
CharacterSpawner.cs:The CharacterSpawner script spawns the selected character at a specified spawn point when the game starts. It retrieves the selected character's index from PlayerPrefs, instantiates the corresponding prefab, and applies its stats (health and speed) to the PlayerController. This ensures the correct character and attributes are used in the gameplay scene.
CursorManager.cs:The CursorManager script dynamically controls the cursor's visibility and locking state based on the game's state. It locks and hides the cursor during gameplay while unlocking and making it visible in the main menu, pause menu, or on the death screen. The script uses Cursor.lockState and Cursor.visible properties and checks for game state conditions, such as Time.timeScale for gameplay, the active scene for the main menu, and the DeathScreen GameObject's state.
