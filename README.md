AudioManager.cs:The AudioManager script centralizes audio control using a singleton pattern to persist across scenes, managing background music (main menu and game) . It provides methods to toggle music on/off based on user settings, ensuring seamless audio transitions and global access throughout the project.
BackGroundMusicManager.cs:The BackgroundMusicManager script plays the appropriate background music for the current scene by checking if the active scene is the Main Menu or another scene and then using the AudioManager to play the corresponding music.
CharacterSelection.cs:The CharacterSelection script manages character preview and selection in the main menu. It allows cycling through an array of character prefabs using next and button, displaying the selected character at a specified position with its stats (name, health, speed) updated in the UI. When "Play" is clicked, the selected character's index is saved using PlayerPrefs, and the gameplay scene is loaded.
CharacterSpawner.cs:The CharacterSpawner script spawns the selected character at a specified spawn point when the game starts. It retrieves the selected character's index from PlayerPrefs, instantiates the corresponding prefab, and applies its stats (health and speed) to the PlayerController. This ensures the correct character and attributes are used in the gameplay scene.
CursorManager.cs:The CursorManager script dynamically controls the cursor's visibility and locking state based on the game's state. It locks and hides the cursor during gameplay while unlocking and making it visible in the main menu, pause menu, or on the death screen. The script uses Cursor.lockState and Cursor.visible properties and checks for game state conditions, such as Time.timeScale for gameplay, the active scene for the main menu, and the DeathScreen GameObject's state.
DeathScript.cs:The DeathTrigger script handles the player's death when they enter a designated trigger area. It stops the score counting by accessing the ScoreManager using Object.FindFirstObjectByType, logs a death message, and can be extended to include additional death-related mechanics (e.g., showing a death screen or respawning).
DesertTrigger.cs:The DesertTrigger script handles interactions when the player enters a trigger zone. It displays a message (e.g., "Desert") on the screen with fade-in/out effects, switches the skybox to a new material, and fully restores the player's health using the PlayerStats component. The script ensures these actions occur only once per player entry and includes debug logs for skybox changes or missing assignments.
Fist.cs:The FistScript handles player fist interactions with enemies. When the fist's trigger collides with an enemy tagged as "Enemy," it applies damage and knockback to the enemy by calling the TakeDamage method on its ScarecrowController. The knockback includes both horizontal and vertical forces, and the script logs each hit for debugging purposes.
GolemController.cs:The script controls a Golem enemy in Unity, giving it behaviors like moving towards and charging at the player. It checks for the player’s position and moves the Golem to it while rotating to face the player. The Golem can charge towards the player with a powerful attack, and after charging, it goes into an idle state for a cooldown period. The Golem also has health and takes damage, dying when its health reaches zero. It deals damage to the player when colliding while charging. Animations are triggered for various states, such as preparing to charge, charging, and idling.
GolemSpawner.cs:The script manages the spawning and despawning of a Golem enemy. It spawns the Golem at a specific Y-level when the player is nearby and within range, and despawns it if the player leaves the area or if the Golem falls below a certain height. The Golem is spawned with a delay, and only one Golem can be active at a time. It ensures the Golem spawns on a valid tile and handles cleanup when the Golem is no longer needed.
PauseMenuScript.cs:The script manages a pause menu in Unity. It toggles the pause state when the Escape key is pressed, showing or hiding the pause menu and adjusting the game’s time scale to pause or resume the game. The script also allows transitioning to an options menu or loading the main menu, ensuring the game resumes before switching scenes. The pause menu and options menu are managed via UI canvases, and game mechanics are paused by setting Time.timeScale to 0 when paused.
PlayerController.cs:The script controls player movement, jumping, sprinting, and dashing. It uses a CharacterController to move the player based on input, allowing for walking, sprinting, and dashing. The player can dash by pressing the middle mouse button, with a defined speed, distance, and deceleration. It also handles jumping with gravity and camera-based mouse look. Additionally, the player can push objects with a Rigidbody when colliding. The script includes a method to update player stats, such as health and speed, and applies force to objects during collisions.
PlayerSpawn.cs:The script spawns the player character at the position of the first hexagonal tile found in the scene or at a fallback spawn point if no hex tile is found. The player is instantiated slightly above the spawn position to prevent clipping with the ground.
